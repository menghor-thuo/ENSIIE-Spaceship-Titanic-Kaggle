# Spaceship_titanic_project
the Spaceship Titanic project on Kaggle is to build a machine learning model that can predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during a fictional interstellar incident. The dataset provided includes information about passengers such as their demographic details, travel information, and personal spending habits on the spaceship.

Participants are tasked with creating predictive models to determine the likelihood of a passenger being transported. The competition tests various machine learning and data analysis skills, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
