# ENSIIE-Spaceship-Titanic-Kaggle
- the Spaceship Titanic project on Kaggle is to build a machine learning model that can predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension during a fictional interstellar incident. The dataset provided includes information about passengers such as their demographic details, travel information, and personal spending habits on the spaceship.

- Participants are tasked with creating predictive models to determine the likelihood of a passenger being transported. The competition tests various machine learning and data analysis skills, including data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
